Machine learning is when a computer program learns, with some similarities to how humans learn. 

A human can learn through a combination of examples, trials & errors, and feedbacks. A machine does it similarly using data, which can be obtained from sample data inputted by a human to get it started (examples), from performing tasks on its own and testing which outputs are acceptable (trials & errors), or by using a variety of ways to perform a task and receiving a score on how time or energy efficiently it performed.

Machine learning is useful since they can learn without the limitations of the human brain, like becoming bored by large amounts of data, getting worn out, or human errors. As long as a machine has electricity, it will do what it is told with virtually zero mistakes. 

For example, a machine can learn to recognize faces from images, and tell one person's face apart from others. This has many useful applications, such as highlighting a smartphone user's face when they try to take a selfie, automatically organizing a person's photos by the faces that are in each photo, or tracking suspicious individuals across the globe using security cameras available. 

A machine can start learning facial recognition by examples, like a sample data containing many images that have different faces. Then, the machine will cycle through each image and find similarities in the images, and since the only shared similarity should be the faces it should recognize overall facial structure, colour changes on different parts of the face, and components/features like eyes. Once that is complete, the machine will try highlighting the faces in the pictures, to show that the machine understands what exactly it is looking for. The machine may fail at first and instead only recognize the eyes or the nose, since everything else on the face may look too different from the same part on other faces. If that is the case, configurations will have to be tweaked to allow the machine to tolerate a more broad defintion of faces. The process of having the machine "look at" sample data may be repeated many times before the machine can successfully recognize faces. The machine would be challenged to look at different pictures and pick out faces that it recognizes. Any step in the process is usually repeated with tweaks until it works.
